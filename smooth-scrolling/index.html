                    Megadeth is an American heavy metal band formed in 1983 by guitarist Dave Mustaine and bassist David
                    Ellefson in Los Angeles, California.
                    Along with Metallica, Anthrax, and Slayer, Megadeth is one of the "big four" of American thrash metal,
                    responsible for its development and popularization.
                    Their music features complex arrangements and fast rhythm sections, and lyrical themes of death, war,
                    politics, personal relationships and religion.

                    In 1985, Megadeth released its debut album, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!, on the
                    independent record label Combat Records, to moderate success.
                    It caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to Megadeth signing with Capitol Records.
                    Their first major-label album, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?, was released in 1986 and was a major
                    hit with the underground metal scene.
                    Band members' substance abuse issues and personal disputes brought Megadeth negative publicity during
                    this period.

                    After the lineup stabilized, Megadeth released a number of platinum-selling albums, including Rust in
                    Peace (1990) and Countdown to Extinction (1992).
                    These albums, along with worldwide tours, brought them public recognition.
                    The band temporarily disbanded in 2002 when Mustaine suffered an arm injury and re-established in 2004
                    without bassist Ellefson, who had taken legal action against Mustaine.
                    Ellefson settled out of court and rejoined in 2010.
                    Megadeth has hosted its own music festival, Gigantour, several times since July 2005.

                    Megadeth has sold 38 million records worldwide,
                    earned platinum certification in the United States for six of its fifteen studio albums,
                    and received twelve Grammy nominations.
                    Megadeth won its first Grammy Award in 2017 for the song "Dystopia" in the Best Metal Performance
                    category.
                    The band's mascot, Vic Rattlehead, regularly appears on album artwork and live shows.
                    The group has drawn controversy for its music and lyrics, including album bans and canceled concerts;
                    MTV refused to play two of the band's music videos that the network considered to condone suicide.

                        On April 11, 1983, Dave Mustaine was fired from Metallica just prior to the band recording their
                        debut album Kill 'Em All due to substance abuse and personal conflicts with James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.
                        As Metallica's lead guitarist since 1981, Mustaine had composed some of the group's early songs and
                        helped hone the band into a tight live unit.
                        Afterward, Mustaine vowed revenge by forming a band that was faster and heavier than Metallica.
                        On the bus trip back to Los Angeles, Mustaine found a pamphlet by California senator Alan
                        Cranston that read: "The arsenal of megadeath can't be rid no matter what the peace treaties come to.
                        "The term "Megadeath" stuck with Mustaine and he wrote a song with the spelling slightly changed to Megadeth, which, according to Mustaine, represented the annihilation of power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After arriving back in Los Angeles, Mustaine began the search for new bandmates.
                        He formed a band with his new neighbors David Ellefson and Greg Handevidt, who had moved from
                        Minnesota and played bass and guitar.
                        While Handevidt would only last a few months, Mustaine and Ellefson formed a tight musical bond.
                        Despite his enthusiasm, Mustaine had trouble finding other members to fill out the lineup.
                        He and Ellefson auditioned about 15 drummers, hoping to find one who understood metre changes in music.
                        After briefly playing with Dijon Carruthers, they selected Lee Rausch.
                        Following six months of trying to find a lead singer, Mustaine decided to fill the role himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1984, Megadeth recorded a three-song demo tape featuring Mustaine, Ellefson, and Rausch.
                        The demo tape, Last Rites, was released on March 9, 1984.
                        It featured early versions of "Last Rites/Loved to Death", "The Skull Beneath the Skin", and
                        "Mechanix", all of which appeared on the band's debut album.
                        The band was unable to find a compatible second guitarist.
                        Kerry King of Slayer filled in on rhythm guitar for several shows in the San Francisco area in the spring of 1984.
                        Afterwards, King went back to Slayer and Megadeth replaced Rausch with jazz fusion drummer Gar Samuelson.
                        Samuelson had previously been in the jazz band the New Yorkers with guitarist Chris Poland.
                        After seeing Samuelson perform with Megadeth as a trio, Poland went backstage and suggested an
                        impromptu audition as lead guitarist for the band; he joined Megadeth in December 1984.

                    <p>
                        After considering several labels, Mustaine signed the band to Combat Records, a New York-based Independent record label that offered Megadeth the highest budget to record and tour.
                        In 1985, Combat Records gave the band $8,000 to record and produce its debut album.
                        After spending $4,000 of the budget on drugs, alcohol, and food, the band fired the original producer and finished the recording themselves.

                    <p> 
                        Despite its low-fidelity sound, Killing Is My Business and Business Is Good! was relatively successful in underground metal circles and attracted major-label interest.
                        Music writer Joel McIver praised its "blistering technicality" and stated that the album "raised the bar for the whole thrash metal scene, with guitarists forced to perform even more accurately and powerfully".
                        The front cover marked the debut of band mascot Vic Rattlehead, who regularly appeared on subsequent album artwork.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Killing Is My Business and Business Is Good! features "Mechanix", a song Mustaine wrote during his time with Metallica.
                        Though Mustaine told the band after his dismissal not to use the music he had written, Metallica recorded a different version of the song, "The Four Horsemen", with a slower tempo and a melodic middle section.
                        The album also included a cover of Nancy Sinatra's "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'," at a faster tempo and with altered lyrics.
                        Megadeth's version generated controversy during the 1990s, when its writer, Lee Hazlewood, called Mustaine's changes "vile and offensive".
                        Under threat of legal action, the song was removed from pressings released from 1995 to 2001.

                    <p>
                        In mid-1985, on a bill with Canadian speed metal band Exciter, Megadeth played its first North American tour: the Killing for a Living Tour.
                        Touring guitarist Mike Albert replaced Poland, who was battling drug addiction.
                        Poland rejoined Megadeth in October 1985, shortly before the group began recording its second album for Combat.

                        <p>
                            According to Mustaine, Megadeth was under pressure to deliver another successful album: "That sophomore offering is the 'be-all or end-all' of any band.
                            You either go to the next level, or it's the beginning of the nadir." 
                            The songs were developed relatively quickly in an old warehouse south of Los Angeles before recording began.
                            Mustaine composed the music, with the other members adding arrangement ideas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The album was produced on a $25,000 budget from Combat Records.
                            Dissatisfied with its financial limitations, the band left Combat and signed with Capitol Records.
                            Capitol bought the rights to the album, and hired producer Paul Lani to remix the earlier recordings.
                            Released in late 1986, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? has clearer production and more sophisticated songwriting.
                            Mustaine wanted to write socially conscious lyrics, unlike mainstream heavy metal bands who sang about "hedonistic pleasures".
                            The album was noted for its political commentary and helped Megadeth expand its fanbase.
                            The title track was the album's lead single and was accompanied by a music video that received regular airplay on MTV.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In February 1987, Megadeth was the opening act on Alice Cooper's Constrictor tour, and the following month began its first headlining world tour in the United Kingdom.
                            The 72-week tour was supported by Overkill and Necros, and continued in the United States.
                            During the tour, Mustaine and Ellefson considered firing Samuelson for his drug abuse.
                            According to Mustaine, Samuelson had become too much to handle when intoxicated.
                            Drummer Chuck Behler traveled with Megadeth for the last dates of the tour as the other band members feared Samuelson would not be able to continue.
                            Poland quarreled with Mustaine, and was accused of selling band equipment to buy heroin.
                            As a result, Samuelson and Poland were asked to leave Megadeth in 1987, with Behler becoming the band's full-time drummer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Poland was initially replaced by Jay Reynolds of Malice, but as the band began working on its next record, Reynolds was replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young, when Megadeth was six weeks into the recording of its third album.
